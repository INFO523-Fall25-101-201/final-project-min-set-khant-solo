We conduct extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key price drivers, including mileage, engine size, car age, and regional sales trends. The core of the project involves building a robust machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor) to accurately predict car prices. Crucially, the model's performance is validated using a temporal train-test split, simulating a real-world scenario where the model predicts 2024 prices based on data up to 2023. The final model achieves a strong temporal stability with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately $531.13, providing high-confidence insights for pricing and inventory optimization strategies.\n\n",
